Tmux
****

  what is Tmux?

  tmux is a terminal multiplexer. It lets us use a single environment to launch
multiple terminals, or windows, each running its own process or program.
For example, we can launch tmux and load up the Vim text editor. We can
then create a new window, load up a database console, and switch back and
forth between these programs all within a single session.

  If you use a modern operating system and a terminal that has tabs, this
doesn’t sound like anything new. But running multiple programs simultane-
ously is only one of tmux’s features. We can divide windows into horizontal
or vertical panes, which means we can run two or more programs on the
same screen side by side. And we can do it all without using the mouse.

  We can also detach from a session, meaning we can leave our environment
running in the background. If you’ve used GNU-Screen before, you’re familiar
with this feature. In many ways, tmux is like GNU-Screen with a lot of extra
features, and a much simpler configuration system. And since tmux uses a
client-server model, we can control windows and panes from a central location,
or even jump between multiple sessions from a single terminal window. This
client-server model also lets us create scripts and interact with tmux from
other windows or applications

  Conventions

  tmux is a tool that’s driven by the keyboard. You’ll encounter many keyboard
shortcuts throughout the book. Since tmux supports both lower- and upper-
case keyboard shortcuts, it may sometimes be unclear which key the book
is referencing.

To keep it simple, these are the conventions I’ve used.

  • C TRL - b means “press the C TRL and b keys simultaneously.”

  • C TRL - R means the same thing, except that you’ll need to use the S HIFT key
to produce the capital “R.” I won’t explicitly show the S HIFT key in any of
these keystrokes.

  • C TRL - b d means “press the C ONTROL and b keys simultaneously, then release,
and then press d .” In Chapter 1, Learning The Basics, on page 1, you’ll
learn about the command prefix, which will use this notation, but short-
ened to P REFIX d .

  • Finally, I’ll show some terminal commands throughout the book, like

    $ tmux new-session

The dollar sign is simply the prompt from the shell session and you won’t
need to type it when you type the command.
